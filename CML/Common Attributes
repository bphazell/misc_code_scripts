Common Attributes

These attributes should be used within the opening tag for a CML form element.

<code>name</code>
Every CML form element parent tag (except <code>cml:group</code>) can have a <code>name</code> attribute. This must be unique across all other form element tags in the job. The name should not contain capital letters, spaces, or non-alpha-numeric characters. This will become a column header in your generated CSV containing the responses for this particular element.

<code>label</code>
Every CML form element parent tag (along with the <code>cml:checkbox</code>, <code>cml:radio</code>, and <code>cml:option</code> children tags) can have a <code>label</code> attribute. This will be displayed next to the generated form element. If no <code>name</code> attribute is specified on a parent tag, the <code>label</code> will be converted into a name by removing non-alpha-numeric characters and replacing spaces with an underscore.

<code>value</code>
Every CML form element child tag (<code>cml:checkbox</code>, <code>cml:radio</code>, and <code>cml:option</code>) can be set with a <code>value</code>. The value of <code>value</code> will determine the output of that particular response in your generated CSV. If no <code>value</code> is specified for a child element, the value of <code>label</code> will be reformatted and used instead.

<code>default</code>
This will allow you to set a default response that will be selected or displayed (in the case of text input) on page-load. When specified on <code>cml:select</code>, it must be set to the label name of the option that will be selected by default. When used on <code>cml:textarea</code> or <code>cml:text</code>, this provides an example input for the user and disappears once the user click into the text box.

<code>instructions</code>
Every CML form element parent tag can have an <code>instructions</code> attribute. This will be displayed next to the generated form element to help clarify the desired input. If both an <code>instructions</code> attribute and a <code><cml:instructions /></code> tag is specified, only the value of the attribute will be used.

<code>only-if</code>
Every CML form element parent tag can have an <code>only-if</code> attribute. The value of this attribute should be the name of the field a user must complete before this field or group of fields will be displayed. To designate logic based on specific responses in a question, take a look at this article on CML Logic.

<code>validates</code>
Every CML form element parent tag can have a <code>validates</code> attribute. This attribute enforces the specified validations to occur on this form element. Take a look at this article on validations for more details.

<code>aggregation</code>
Every CML form element parent tag can have an <code>aggregation</code> attribute. This attribute tells us how to aggregate your data once it has been collected. Take a look at this article on aggregation for more details.
