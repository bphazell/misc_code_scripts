// First, open up a terminal window that will always run in the background and type in:

ssh -N -L {{port}}:localhost:5432 {{username}}@{{db}}.cloud.doloreslabs.com



// run psql locally on your workstation to the SSH port you have forwarded using the "-L" flag
// you must give ssh the "-N" flag to tell it not to try to give you a shell on the server

// The only caviat is that the port may already be taken, so the first '5432' can be any number less than 65535 and greater than 1024.

// This will set up a DB connection that stays open in the background.  Then open a new terminal window and type in:

psql -h localhost -p {{port}} -U postgres builder 



// where the {{port}} number is the number used above.
